For any tasks given to me during my Internship.

# TO-DO List Application
    This to-do list application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can enter their name, create tasks by specifying content and category (business or personal), and add them to the list. The app uses LocalStorage to save tasks, ensuring persistence across sessions. The user interface is styled with custom CSS and Google Fonts.
